    Whether you are spending days in Kathmandu or just make it a quick stop, Boudhanath should definitely be on the top of your bucket list. Boudhanath is the quintessential experience one should have when visiting Kathmandu.
    I ve been countless times to Boudhanath; and if there is one place that gets me excited in Kathmandu, it surely this one. Bold, vibrant and colorful, the bustling Boudhanath is, in fact, one of my favorite. <br> <br>
    Everything in Boudha dazzles me. Sure, the chaotic streets and the daunting traffic with hundreds of cars, taxis, buses, motorcycles (a lot of motorcycles!), cows, dogs and pedestrians, can be quite impressive; yet, it is probably the only location I know where you can easily find peace amidst chaos. Is that even possible? Boudhanath is a treasure and I can recommend it enough. The giant stupa is one of the most beautiful spots in the capital city. And still today, it my favorite area to wander in Kathmandu. <br>

 <h2>History of Boudhanath</h2>
<p>The earliest historical references to the Khaasti Chaitya are found in the Chronicles of the Newars. First, Khaasti is mentioned as one of the four stupas found by the Licchavi king Vrisadeva (c. AD 400) or Vikramjit. Second, the Newars legend of the stupa's origin attributes it to king Dharmadeva's son, Manadeva as atonement for his unwitting parricide Manadeva was the great Licchavi king, military conqueror and the patron of the arts who reigned c. AD (464-505). Manadeva is also linked with the Swayambhu Chaitya of Gum Bahal. Third, another great Licchhavi king Shivadeva (AD 590-604) is associated with Boudha by an inscription; he may have restored the chaitya. <br> <br>
    There are a lot of legends and stories surrounding the construction of the Boudhanath stupa. <br><br>
    One of the most famous legends says that in the 4th century, King Dharmadeva installed stone water taps (known as 'Dhunge Dhara' in Nepali) in the palace courtyards but no water came out from the taps. The King decided to consult his astrologers and was told that in order to receive water, it will require the performance of a human sacrifice, more specifically ‘the sacrifice of the most virtuous man in the kingdom’. The King realized that only him and his son were eligible. The King decided to sacrifice himself but not wanting his son to know that he will perform the sacrifice on himself, he instructed him to decapitate a shrouded form lying near the palace the same night. His son, the prince Manadeva, followed his father’s instructions; he decapitated the covered corpse and horrified, saw the head of his father flew to the Vajrayogini temple. Once his son realized he killed his father, he was regretful. The deity Vajrayogini told Dharmadeva’ son, the new King Manadeva, that the only way to undo his sin was to let a cock fly from the temple and then, wherever the cock lands will be the place where Manadeva should build a stupa for his father remains. The cock eventually landed where Boudhanath stupa stands today.  <br><br>

<h2>What to do in Boudhanath?</h2>
<h3>Walk in clockwise direction around the stupa.</h3>
<p>For Buddhist people it is a daily ritual to walk three or more times around the stupa while repeating the mantra 'Om Mani Padme Hum', either quietly or aloud. It is believed that walking around in an anti-clockwise direction is bad luck and disrespectful.</p>
